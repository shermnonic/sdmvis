\begin{abstract}
SDMVIS is a visual analysis software to explore statistical deformation
models (SDM) of volumetric organisms. Interactive exploration is facilitated
by integrating two kinds of expert knowledge: taxonomical or other
classifications of the datasets as well as knowledge about relevant
structures and parts of the shape. Given a classification into two
groups the corresponding dominant shape differences between the groups
(a so-called trait) can be computed and visualized in a dynamic fashion.
Based on a selected region of interest (ROI) a new weighted SDM can
be derived whose principal modes of shape variability are again accessible
in a dynamic visualization.

SDMVIS assumes as input an already registered subset of your data,
see Figure~\ref{fig:pipeline}. For now an initial shape model has
also to be provided (which will hopefully soon be obsolete). The user
interface is designed task-oriented with respect to the following
visual analysis tasks:
\begin{itemize}
\item Investigate PCA model \texttt{\textbf{{[}PCA Model{]}}}
\item Investigate and/or compute trait model \texttt{\textbf{{[}Trait Model{]}}}
\item Spefiy a region of interest and compute a new PCA model \texttt{\textbf{{[}Specify
ROI{]}}}
\item Assess shape variability of an eigenwarp or trait in a static visualization
\texttt{\textbf{{[}Glyph visualization{]}}}
\item Assess registration quality visually \texttt{\textbf{{[}Registration
visualization{]}}}
\item Prepare results in a table e.g. for exporting to Excel \texttt{\textbf{{[}Dataset{]}}}
\end{itemize}
In braces the shorthand term for the specific task respectively mode
in SDMVIS is given. Only one mode can be active at a given time. The
user interface provides a tab-bar to switch between the different
modes. Each mode has its own controls and visualization as indicated
in Figure~\ref{fig:gui}.


\section{Data Management\label{sec:Data-Management}}

The data management concept is not finished yet. We currently rely
on configuration files which represent a specific analysis session
in SDMVIS, see also Table~\ref{tab:analysis_items}. To discern different
analyses an identifying keyword has to be specified by the user for
each analysis.

The current data management approach can be summarized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Data files follow a specific naming convention.
\item Relevant files of a \emph{specific analysis} are stored in a single
directory.
\item A single \emph{configuration file} holds the needed filenames and
additional parameters of a specific analysis (see Table~\ref{tab:analysis_items}).
\item SDMVIS \emph{automatically} creates configuration files and the needed
directory structure for trait and/or ROI analyses.
\item For now, each analysis is identified by a user specified line of text
or a \emph{keyword}.
\end{itemize}
By performing a ROI selection a new SDM is derived for which a new
analysis with SDMVIS has to be performed. Thus SDMVIS automatically
creates a new configuration file which is loaded immediately after
creation. All relevant data files are stored in a sub-directory of
the original analysis configuration file. The new sub-directory is
named according to the new keyword specified for the ROI analysis.

Computing a new trait does not change the current SDM and the current
configuration file is simply updated. The newly created trait files
are stored in a sub-directory named according to the keyword of the
current analysis.

The datasets and mean estimate as well as all eigen- and traitwarps
are stored as Metaimage MHD files. These can be loaded and displayed
by most Visualization Software Packages like for example ParaView.

\item trait separating hyperplane is shown in green (if available)
\item in \texttt{{[}Trait Model{]}} view:

\begin{itemize}
\item single items may be selected by clicking on them
\item right click in diagram area opens context menu with further options
\item {}``Free Item'' mode provides dynamic visualization

\item warp coefficient(s) can be adjusted by manipulating the bar plot to
the lower right of the control widget
\item in \texttt{{[}PCA Model{]}} one can alternatively use the {}``Free
Item'' mode of the PCA plot (right click on the PCA diagram to activate
the context menu from which the Free Item mode can be set)
\item in \texttt{{[}Trait Model{]}} the warp scaling parameter has to be
adjusted manually

for a faithfull investigation)
\item supports contour rendering of the surface as well as volume rendering
(in rainbow colors)
\item can compute and visualize the difference between the aligned and the
registered volume (as shown on the screenshot); this maybe a usefull
visualization to estimate the registration quality of specific areas
